Very simple asp.net 8 example for accessing QuickBooks Online (QBO)

Don't put this in to production as its purpose is to show what you need to do to call QBO if you want to use ASP.Net and Identity, Authentication & Authorization.

Uses the QuickBooks Authentication Provider AspNet.Security.OAuth.QuickBooks for external authorizaiton and to get access & refresh token

I'm working on a solution that extends this out with appropriate DI services for QuickBooks and a TokenService (caching & auto token refresh)

Let me know if this something you are interested in.
